# Week-1
# Smart Energy Consumption Optimization - Week 1

## Project Description
We analyze how we can use machine learning to learn dataset of household and tell us how we are overutilizing electricity in our day to day life, how we can 
use it keeping in mind about the future generation and keeping it in our mind to keep our some of our money safe from over usage of electricity. 

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Household Electricity Consumption]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/240000-household-electricity-consumption-records))
- **Size**: 240000+ records, 9 features
- **Features**: Date, Time, Global_active_power, Global_reactive_power, voltage, Global_intensity, sub_metering_1, sub_metering_2, sub_metering_3

## Week 1 Tasks Completed

- Basic Data Cleaning
- Data Splitiing

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab, GitHub

## Files
- `WEEK1_SMART_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `household_power_consumption.csv` - Dataset

# Week 2

In week 2 i work with the same dataset because it is the best dataset that i can get to train my model

## Week 2 Tasks completed
- Firstly I divided my model in two parts one is target and other is generic .
- The genric part is x and the target is y.
- I split these two in further two parts one for training and other for testing.
- Then by looking at the dataset i cna clearly see that we have to use linear regression on our dataset to train it.
- I applied linear regression and find MSE, MAE, R^2 coefficient.

## Week 2 Completed from my side
