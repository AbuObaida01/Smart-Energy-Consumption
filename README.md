# Week-1
# Smart Energy Consumption Optimization - Week 1

## Project Description
We analyze how we can use machine learning to learn dataset of household and tell us how we are overutilizing electricity in our day to day life, how we can 
use it keeping in mind about the future generation and keeping it in our mind to keep our some of our money safe from over usage of electricity. 

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Household Electricity Consumption]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/240000-household-electricity-consumption-records))
- **Size**: 240000+ records, 9 features
- **Features**: Date, Time, Global_active_power, Global_reactive_power, voltage, Global_intensity, sub_metering_1, sub_metering_2, sub_metering_3
