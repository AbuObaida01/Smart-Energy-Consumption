# Week-1
# Smart Energy Consumption Optimization - Week 1

## Project Description
Analyzing household energy consumption patterns to build an AI-powered recommendation system for optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Household Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samxsam/household-energy-consumption)
- **Size**: 90,000 records, 7 features
- **Features**: Household_ID, Date, Energy_Consumption_kWh, Household_Size, Avg_Temperature_C, Has_AC, Peak_Hours_Usage_kWh

## Week 1 Tasks Completed
- Importing Libraries
- Dataset Overview
- Inspecting the data structure
- Checking For Missing Values
- Basic Data Cleaning
- Data Splitiing
- Extra Part (Data Visualization)

## Result we found
- Average daily consumption: ~7.5 kWh per household
- Households with AC consume significantly more energy
- Larger households show 15-20% higher consumption
- Peak hours account for ~40% of daily usage

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab, GitHub

## Files
- `WEEK1_SMART_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `household_energy_consumption.csv` - Dataset
